Forecst
=======

Simple status bar app written in RubyMotion.

It uses the Forecast.io API to send notifcations at set intervals that contain the coming hours weather forecast.

### Note about release.

There are definitely some areas where it can be improved and I aim to do this over the next few weeks. (check out that #menu method :|)

I've open sourced it because it was never put up on the MAS (Mac App Store) and some people might get something
from it.

Feel free to send PR's if you would like.

### Registering an API key

To use the Forecast.io API, you need to register for an API key: https://developer.forecast.io. Then you can update the `API_KEY` variable found in `weather.rb`.
