Forecst
=======

Simple status bar app written in RubyMotion.

It uses the Forecast.io API to send notifcations at set intervals that contain the coming hours weather forecast.

### Note about release.

I've open sourced it because it was never put up on the MAS (Mac App Store) and some people might get something
from it. There are definately some areas where it can be improved. (check out that menu method :/)

Over the next few weeks I'll aim to clean the code up.
